#Define a function named heating_cooling that takes in 2 parameters: actual_temp and a desired_temp.
#Print one of these three things: Run A/C, Run heat, or Standby depending on input.

"""
Define a function named convert_temp with 2 parameters: temp_celsius (a number)
and target_unit (a string, either “C”, “F”, or “K”).
Write a switch statement that checks the target_unit and returns the temperature converted to that unit.
Notes: K stands for Kelvin. C requires no conversion, return the original temp.
